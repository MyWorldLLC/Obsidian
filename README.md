# Obsidian UI

Obsidian is a framework for embedding JavaFX in games or
other applications where windows and displays cannot be
managed by JavaFX. While one can do this with JavaFX's
internal APIs, they are fairly verbose and are not trivial
to use correctly. Obsidian provides a much higher-level, easier
to use API for embedding JavaFX.
